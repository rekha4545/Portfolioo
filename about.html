    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Rekha and I am a passionate MCA student at Sastra University. I am currently seeking exciting opportunities to kickstart my career in the tech industry and make a positive impact.</p>
    <p>My journey in the field of computer applications started with a curiosity to understand how technology can change the world. I have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities and innovations that technology brings. This curiosity led me to pursue my Masters in Computer Applications and I have been constantly learning and growing ever since.</p>
    <p>During my time at Sastra, I have gained a strong foundation in various programming languages, database management, and software development. I have also had the opportunity to work on several projects, both individually and in teams, which have honed my technical skills and taught me the importance of collaboration.</p>
    <p>Apart from my academic pursuits, I have also been actively involved in extracurricular activities. I have organized and participated in various events, which have helped me develop my leadership, communication, and time-management skills.</p>
    <p>As I enter the job market, I am looking for a challenging role in a reputed organization where I can apply my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems. I am eager to learn and adapt to new technologies and be a part of a dynamic team that shares my passion.</p>
